approxExtrap(
  x,
  y,

\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a vector of x-coordinates of points to be interpolated, or a list with
components \code{x} and \code{y}. If a list is provided, the \code{y} parameter is ignored.}

\item{y}{Vector of y-coordinates of points to be interpolated, corresponding to \code{x}.}

\item{xout}{Vector of points at which to evaluate the interpolation/extrapolation.}

\item{method}{Specifies the interpolation method. Only "linear" is currently supported.
The default is "linear".}

\item{n}{If \code{xout} is not specified, interpolation is done at \code{n} equally spaced points
covering the range of \code{x}. The default is 50.}

\item{rule}{An integer (1 or 2) describing how interpolation is to take place outside
the interval \link{min(x), max(x)}. See \code{approx()} for details. The default is 2.}

\item{f}{For \code{method = "constant"}, a number between 0 and 1 inclusive, indicating how
interpolation should behave at jump discontinuities. See \code{approx()} for details.
The default is 0.}

\item{ties}{Handling of tied \code{x} values. See \code{approx()} for details. The default is "ordered".}

\item{na.rm}{Logical indicating whether NA values should be removed before interpolation.
The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\item{x}{The x-coordinates where interpolation was performed (same as input \code{xout})}
\item{y}{The interpolated/extrapolated y-values corresponding to \code{xout}}
}
\description{
Performs linear interpolation using \code{approx()} with linear extrapolation beyond the data range.
This function is particularly useful when you need to estimate values outside the range of
your observed data points.
}
\details{
The function first performs standard linear interpolation using \code{approx()}. For points
outside the range of the input data, it performs linear extrapolation using the slope
defined by the first two points (for low extrapolation) or last two points (for high
extrapolation).

The function handles duplicate x-values by removing them and orders the data by x-values
to ensure proper interpolation and extrapolation.

\examples{
# Basic interpolation and extrapolation
x <- 1:5
y <- c(2, 4, 3, 6, 5)
approxExtrap(x, y, xout = c(0, 1, 3.5, 5, 6))

# With NA values (when na.rm = TRUE)
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 5)
approxExtrap(x, y, xout = 1:6, na.rm = TRUE)
