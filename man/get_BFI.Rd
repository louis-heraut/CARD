\title{Compute Baseflow Index}
\usage{
get_BFI(Q, BF, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{Numeric vector of streamflow/discharge values \link{L³/T}}

\item{BF}{Numeric vector of baseflow values \link{L³/T}, typically obtained from a
baseflow separation method (must be same length as Q)}

\item{na.rm}{Logical indicating whether to ignore missing values (NA) in the calculations.
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the baseflow index:
\itemize{
\item 0 indicates all streamflow is quickflow (surface runoff)
\item 1 indicates all streamflow is baseflow
}
}
\description{
Calculates the Baseflow Index (BFI), defined as the ratio of total baseflow
volume to total streamflow volume over a given period. The BFI represents the proportion
of streamflow that comes from baseflow (groundwater contributions).
}
\details{
The Baseflow Index is calculated as:
\deqn{BFI = \frac{\sum BF}{\sum Q}}

\strong{Important notes:}
\itemize{
\item The function assumes both vectors cover the same time period
\item No automatic alignment of time series is performed
\item Negative values in either vector will produce invalid results
\item Results are only meaningful when using consistent units for Q and BF
}

\examples{
# Example using synthetic data
Q <- c(10, 12, 15, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 9)  # Streamflow
BF <- c(8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7)          # Baseflow

# Calculate BFI
bfi <- get_BFI(Q, BF)
print(paste("Baseflow Index:", round(bfi, 3)))

# With missing values
Q[3] <- NA
get_BFI(Q, BF)               # Returns NA
get_BFI(Q, BF, na.rm=TRUE)   # Ignores NA
