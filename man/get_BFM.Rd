\title{Baseflow Magnitude}
\usage{
get_BFM(BFA)
}
\arguments{
\item{BFA}{Numeric vector of inter-annual daily average of baseflow values \link{LÂ³/T}}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing baseflow variability:
\itemize{
\item 0 indicates no seasonal variability (constant baseflow)
\item 1 indicates extreme variability (minimum baseflow approaches zero)
}
}
\description{
Calculates the relative difference between maximum and minimum values in a
baseflow time series, representing the seasonal variability of baseflow contributions.
}
\details{
The Baseflow Regime Magnitude is calculated as:
\deqn{BFM = \frac{BFA_{max} - BFA_{min}}{BFA_{max}}}

Where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{BFA_{max}} is the maximum baseflow in the series
\item \eqn{BFA_{min}} is the minimum baseflow in the series
}

\strong{Key characteristics:}
\itemize{
\item Returns a value between 0 (no variability) and 1 (maximum variability)
\item Handles missing values (NA) automatically
\item No smoothing is applied to the input series
\item Particularly useful for comparing seasonal baseflow patterns between catchments
}
}
\examples{
# Example with synthetic baseflow data (annual cycle)
baseflow <- c(rep(5,90), rep(8,90), rep(12,90), rep(7,95)) # Seasonal pattern
result <- get_BFM(baseflow)

print(paste("Baseflow variability:", round(result$magnitude, 2)))
print(paste("Maximum baseflow:", round(result$max, 2)))
print(paste("Minimum baseflow:", round(result$min, 2)))

# Example with real data (would need actual baseflow series)
# data(streamflow)
# bf <- BFS(streamflow$Q, method="LH")
# get_BFM(bf)
